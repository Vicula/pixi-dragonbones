# pixi-dragonbones

Pixi.js plugin that enables Dragonbones support.

## Building

You will need to have [node][node] and [gulp][gulp] setup on your machine.

Then you can install dependencies and build:

```js
npm i && npm run build
```

That will output the built distributables to `./dist`.

[node]:       http://nodejs.org/
[gulp]:       http://gulpjs.com/

## Testing

For now there are no real tests, but I setup simple app to see if anything works.

Just run `./app/index.html` using your local webserver.

Task for compiling is named app and it is included in npm build task.
